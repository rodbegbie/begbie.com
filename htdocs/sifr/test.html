		Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,<br>

		Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
		While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
		As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
		`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -<br>
		Only this, and nothing more.'<br><br>

		Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
		And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
		Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow<br>

		From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -<br>
		For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -<br>
		Nameless here for evermore.<br><br>

		And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
		Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
		So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
		`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -<br>
		Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -<br>

		This it is, and nothing more,'<br><br>

		Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
		`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
		But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
		And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
		That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -<br>
		Darkness there, and nothing more.<br><br>

		Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>

		Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before<br>
		But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br>
		And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'<br>
		This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'<br> 
		Merely this and nothing more.<br><br>

		Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
		Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>
		`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>

		Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -<br>
		Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -<br>
		'Tis the wind and nothing more!'<br><br>

		Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
		In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.<br>
		Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
		But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -<br>
		Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -<br>

		Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br><br>

		Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
		By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
		`Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.<br>
		Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -<br>
		Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'<br>
		Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>

		Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;<br>
		For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
		Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -<br>
		Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
		With such name as `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,<br>
		That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
		Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -<br>

		Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -<br>
		On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'<br>
		Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
		`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>
		Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster<br>
		Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -<br>
		Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br>

		Of "Never-nevermore."'<br><br>

		But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>
		Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br>
		Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
		Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -<br>
		What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
		Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>

		To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
		This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
		On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br>
		But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br>
		<i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!<br><br>

		Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
		Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>

		`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee<br>
		Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
		Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'<br>
		Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -<br>
		Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
		Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -<br>
		On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -<br>

		Is there - <i>is</i> there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'<br>
		Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
		By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -<br>
		Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
		It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -<br>
		Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?'<br>

		Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -<br>
		`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
		Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
		Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!<br>
		Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'<br>
		Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br><br>

		And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>

		On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
		And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
		And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
		And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
		Shall be lifted - nevermore!<p>
